# Face-Recognition-App

Face recognition uses AI algorithms and ML to detect human faces from the background. The algorithm typically starts by searching for human eyes, followed by eyebrows, nose and mouth.

How does the programme work-

1.Your face is detected and a picture of it is captured from a photo or video.

2.The software reads your facial features. Key factors that play a role in the detection process can differ from each other based on what mapping technique the database and algorithm use. 

3.The algorithm verifies your face by encoding it into a facial signature (a formula, strain of numbers, etc.) and comparing it with databases of known faces, looking whether there is a match.
